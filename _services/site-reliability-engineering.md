## Your Watchtower for Distributed Systems

MiradorStack represents the future of observability - a unified platform that brings together metrics, logs, and traces in a privacy-first architecture designed for regulated industries. Built with deep OpenTelemetry integration and airgapped deployment capabilities.

### Core Observability Components

**MiradorStack Platform**
- Unified telemetry collection and processing
- Deep OpenTelemetry integration for vendor neutrality
- Privacy-first architecture for regulated industries
- Airgapped deployment support for secure environments

**Telegen Agent**
- Single agent for multiple telemetry signals
- Host-level eBPF observability with minimal overhead
- Prometheus and OTLP export capabilities
- Eliminates agent sprawl and resource conflicts

**Advanced Analytics**
- Isolation Forest processor for anomaly detection
- Real-time root cause analysis (RCA) capabilities
- Machine learning-powered insights
- Automated pattern recognition and alerting

**Network Observability**
- Telegen-Sonic for SONiC network monitoring
- ERSPAN and port-mirroring integration
- BGP route monitoring and analysis
- High-performance packet processing with DPDK
