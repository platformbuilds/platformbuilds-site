<div class="story-cards">
  <div class="card">
    <h3>Made in India, for the World</h3>
    <p>At <strong>Platformbuilds</strong>, we believe the next era of innovation will not be built in isolation — it will be built through <strong>global collaboration</strong> grounded in <strong>local strength</strong>.</p>
    <p>Born in India, we are driven by a simple conviction:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><em>If India could give the world a digital public good like UPI, we can also attempt to build the world's most open and trustworthy AI Cloud on the Open Source rails!</em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Our journey began with a mission to create the <strong>Sovereign AI Cloud @ #PopulationScale</strong> — a programmable, transparent, and federated cloud designed to serve <strong>a billion users</strong> today and the <strong>entire world</strong> tomorrow.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>From Blueprint to Reality</h3>
    <p>The story of Platformbuilds started with the <strong>Open Cloud Compute (OCC)</strong> framework — a new open standard for <strong>federated, composable, and sovereign cloud infrastructure</strong>.</p>
    <p>Built on open hardware and open source, OCC laid the foundation for what we call <strong>Digital Public Infrastructure for Compute</strong> — as transformative as UPI, but for AI and data workloads.</p>
    <p>We are now turning this blueprint into a real platform: the <strong>Sovereign AI Cloud</strong>, a production-grade environment that unites compute, storage, networking, observability, and AI orchestration into one seamless layer.</p>
    <p>Today, the platform offers <strong>ten core services</strong> — from <strong>Inference-as-a-Service (InfAAS)</strong> and <strong>VMaaS</strong> to <strong>DBaaS</strong>, <strong>MiradorStack observability</strong>, and <strong>SDN</strong> networking — all open, vendor-neutral, and ready to scale globally.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Engineering Sovereignty Through Collaboration</h3>
    <p>Sovereignty is not about isolation — it's about <strong>choice, trust, and cooperation</strong>.</p>
    <p>Our ecosystem is proudly <strong>Made in India</strong>, but it is <strong>built for the world</strong></p>
    <p>Together, we're proving that open collaboration — across vendors, nations, and technologies — can build a truly <strong>borderless AI infrastructure</strong> that benefits everyone.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Sustained by Abundance, Not Dependency</h3>
    <p>Every component of our cloud is rooted in <strong>open standards and shared knowledge</strong>.</p>
    <p>From <strong>Kubernetes</strong> to <strong>OpenTelemetry</strong>, from <strong>SONiC</strong> to <strong>PostgreSQL/MariaDB/Cassandra/Kafka</strong> — our technology stack uses tools supported by millions of engineers worldwide.</p>
    <p>Our philosophy is simple: <strong>Sovereignty through Openness</strong> and <strong>Sustainability through Collaboration</strong>.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Our Purpose</h3>
    <p>We exist to <strong>democratize compute, observability, and AI</strong> — for every person, every organization, and every nation.</p>
    <p>We're not building a product; we're building <strong>a public utility for intelligence</strong> — one that powers financial inclusion, research, sustainability, and next-generation digital ecosystems.</p>
    <p>Every workload that runs on our cloud strengthens our collective intelligence — creating a future where <strong>technology unites humanity instead of dividing it.</strong></p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>The Road Ahead</h3>
    <p>As we scale beyond borders, our goal is to make the <strong>Sovereign AI Cloud</strong> a <strong>global digital commons</strong> — governed by transparency, inclusivity, and trust.</p>
    <p>At <strong>Platformbuilds</strong>, we are <strong>made in India</strong> — but our purpose is <strong>for the world</strong>.<br>
    Because the future of technology must be <strong>open, sovereign, and shared.</strong></p>
