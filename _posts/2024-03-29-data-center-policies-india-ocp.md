3. **Improve power infrastructure** (renewable integration).  
4. **Build sovereign AI capabilities** through OCP-based infrastructure.

### **Growth Projections:**  
- India to become **2nd-largest APAC DC market by 2030**.  
- **Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad** = Key hubs competing with Singapore.  
- **Sovereign AI infrastructure** will drive next wave of DC investments.

---

## **7. Conclusion**  

- **India's DC policies are improving** but need **longer-term incentives and sustainability focus**.  
- **OCP can be a game-changer** for cost and energy efficiency, particularly for sovereign AI infrastructure.  
- **Next steps:** Government-industry collaboration to adopt global best practices and build independent AI capabilities.
