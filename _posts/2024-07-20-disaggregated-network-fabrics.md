## **Introduction**  

Traditional networking has long been dominated by **vendor-locked, proprietary solutions** where hardware and software are tightly coupled. But as data centers scale to support **AI workloads**, **5G**, and **hyperscale applications**, organizations are turning to **disaggregated network fabrics**‚Äîa revolutionary approach that separates networking hardware from software, unlocking unprecedented flexibility, cost savings, and innovation.

This transformation is particularly crucial for **sovereign AI infrastructure**, where nations and organizations seek vendor-independent, customizable networking solutions that can scale to population-level requirements.

## **What Are Disaggregated Network Fabrics?**  

Disaggregated networking **decouples hardware from software**, allowing organizations to:
- Choose **best-of-breed components** independently
- Run **open-source Network Operating Systems (NOS)** on commodity hardware
- Avoid **vendor lock-in** while gaining operational flexibility

### **Key Components:**  
- **White-box switches** (commodity hardware from ODMs like Edgecore, Delta, UfiSpace).  
- **Open NOS options** (SONiC, FRRouting, DANOS) or commercial NOS ([Arrcus ArcOS](https://arrcus.com/connected-edge/arcos)).
- **SDN controllers** (ONOS, OpenDaylight) for centralized automation.  
- **Kubernetes + BGP + Any CNI + Any Network Fabric** [Cosmolet](https://github.com/platformbuilds/cosmolet)

## **Why Are Industries Adopting Disaggregated Fabrics?**  

### **1. Cost Efficiency**  
- **50-70% lower CAPEX** compared to traditional vendor solutions.

- **Example:** Google's **Jupiter network** connects thousands of TPUs with minimal latency.  

### **4. Financial Services & High-Frequency Trading**  
- **Use Case:** Ultra-low-latency financial switching networks including UPI.
- **Example:** [NPCI](https://www.npci.org.in/) uses Commodity Switches like Edgecore, UfiSpace with [ArcOS](https://arrcus.com/) and Sonic for [UPI](https://www.npci.org.in/what-we-do/upi/product-overview)

### **5. Internet Service Providers (ISPs)**  
- **Use Case:** Disaggregated BNGs, peering routers.  
- **Example:** Lumen uses **DriveNets' Network Cloud** for scalable internet gateways.

## **Building a Basic Disaggregated Network Fabric**

![Basic Disaggregated Fabric HLD](/assets/images/disaggregated-fabric-hld-1.png)

### **1. Overview**

A disaggregated fabric typically follows a **spine-leaf architecture** where:
- **Leaf switches** connect directly to servers/endpoints
- **Spine switches** provide non-blocking connectivity between leaf switches
- **BGP routing** enables dynamic path selection and load balancing
- **Commodity hardware** runs open-source or commercial NOS

### **2. Key Components**

#### **a. Spine Layer (Terabit Switches)**

* High-bandwidth **terabit switches** form the spine.
* Provide **non-blocking any-to-any connectivity** across racks.
* Commodity options: Edgecore, UfiSpace with Broadcom Tomahawk ASICs.
* NOS options: **SONiC, Cumulus Linux, FRRouting (FRR)**.

---

#### **b. Leaf Layer (Gigabit Switches)**

* Connects directly to compute nodes.
* Aggregates traffic upward to spine switches.
* White-box gigabit switches are deployed here with **100Gbps NIC support** for high-performance nodes.

---

#### **c. Compute Nodes**

* Mixture of **CPU-based x86 or ARM servers** for general workloads.
* **GPU-based servers (NVIDIA or AMD)** for AI/ML or HPC workloads.
* Each node connects to one or more leaf switches for redundancy and bandwidth aggregation.

---

### **3. Deployment Principles**

#### **a. Disaggregation**

* Use **commodity white-box switches** from ODMs.
* Load **open NOS (e.g., SONiC) or commercial NOS (e.g., Arrcus ArcOS)** as per operational maturity.

---

#### **b. BGP to the Host**

* All nodes run **BGP peering directly from host to network**, enabled by:

  * **FRRouting (FRR)** in the host OS.
  * **IPv6 Unnumbered** for link scalability.
  * **BFD (Bidirectional Forwarding Detection)** for rapid failover.
  * **ECMP (Equal Cost Multi-Pathing)** for traffic load balancing across multiple links.

---

#### **c. DPUs/NPUs for High Performance**

* Use **Data Processing Units (DPU) or Network Processing Units (NPU)** to realize **100Gbps per NIC** efficiently.
* Combine with:

  * **DPDK** for kernel bypass packet processing.
  * **NOS + BGP + Cosmolet** for Kubernetes-aware BGP service advertisement.

---

### **4. Key Benefits**

* **Cost Optimization**: 50-70% reduction in networking CAPEX.
* **Flexibility**: Mix vendors, NOS, and hardware as needed.
* **Scalability**: Add capacity incrementally without forklift upgrades.
* **Innovation**: Rapid deployment of new features and protocols.
* **Sovereignty**: Complete control over network infrastructure and data paths.

### **5. Implementation Summary**

1. **Procure commodity white-box switches** for spine and leaf layers.
2. **Install an open NOS** like SONiC with FRRouting support.
3. **Design BGP peering to each host**, enabling dynamic routing and failover.
4. **Deploy DPUs/NPUs** on compute nodes needing line-rate performance.
5. Integrate **Cosmolet or similar controllers** for Kubernetes service advertisement if deploying containerized workloads.
6. **Test failover, ECMP load balancing, and BGP route convergence** before production rollout.
